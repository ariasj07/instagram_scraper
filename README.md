# Instagram Scraper
**Instagram Scraper** is a Python Script to get all the images from a profile
> This project is going to be upgraded and new features will be added soon

### ¿How does it work?
The script directly makes a post to the profile you indicate, if the profile is private, it will only work if **you follow the profile** otherwise, it won't work

### ¿How to use it?
You need to follow a few steps
- Go to Instagram
- Open "Storage" in the web console (Pressing f12 usually)
- Go to Cookies, select the one who refers to instagram.com
- Get the "csrftoken" and the "sessionid"
**Those tokens eventually are going to expire** so, sometimes depending on your browser it'll tell you when are going to expire (usually in the next 1-2 hours)
